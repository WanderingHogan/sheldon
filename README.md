**Here is a sneak peek at the project:**

[Distance Selection Example](http://hoganmaps.github.io/distance-selection-turf?la)
This example has two CSV's. 'sf' and 'la'. To switch between one and another, change the URL to be one of the CSV names in the data folder.

## Setup

**Clone the repo:**

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/hoganmaps/distance-selection-turf.git
```

**Install Bower Dependencies**
```bash
  $bower install
```

**Open the app in your browser:**

A simple way is to install `nano-server` is as a global install through **npm**:

```bash
  $ npm install -g nano-server
```

Then `nano-server` can be invoked as a command line executable:

```bash
  $ nano-server
```

By default, `nano-server` will run on port **5000** and use the current working directory as its document root. Optionally, a port number can be passed as first argument on the command line:

```bash
  $ nano-server 3000
```
